regard agency customer concentration issue think within business part reason see volatility anything heffernan part andrew look big client epsilon agency side business pull back project maybe support particular offering move needle quickly project base volatility intra quarter quite bit year pretty well estimate basically open faucet close quite quickly base upon want marketing spend see q1 basically close spigot think open year progress sound alarm bell big company big budget flex quite quickly andrew jeffrey okay quickly regard outlook may loss rate plateau 2018 beyond dig little bit rationale thought process give confidence might see something pretty unprecedented historically term stable charge heffernan yes look great question fact talk bulk growth 10 core growth see really come account mature well season well past peak charge cycle normalize loss rate think maybe two stat might helpful look think great recession normalize loss rate 65 say comfortable long term run rate normalize towards probably couple interesting stat one new mix co brand carry higher score customer well high end type retailer join attract card holder tend skew little bit higher credit spectrum example compare active account today versus 2007 score today average high 2007 even lot account add recently active account basis average score high also look balance perspective average score per

operator ashish sabadra deutsche bank ashish sabadra analyst deutsche bank thank quick follow agency weakness agency  worsen well core epsilon wonder decline see consistent across segment charles mention intra quarter volatility depend project something strategically forward lower volatility tech continue grow fast big portion revenue wonder think volatility come agency volatile last several quarter charles horn right ashish grow technology piece business quick frankly agency good year grow 3 technology good year grow 10 plus mix standpoint basically take volatility away look breakdown weakness category see weakness traditional agency epsilon see weakness across many vertical could pinpoint one client broad base conversant side traditional display definitely see people try use private exchange get big agency try push programmatic buying trading platform regardless quality impression provide try stuff system see general pull back little bit unexpected would say side think get stability year really back ed point nothing particularly point aside seem like soft spend q1 ashish sabadra okay quickly margin epsilon business highlight couple reason margin low think margin forward technically agency tend low margin tech high margin business tech grow fast would expect margin go go forward want better understand think dynamic epsilon margin next several quarter also long term charles horn way would look basically right agency grower slow low ebitda margin technology grow quick high ebitda margin pure mix standpoint get ebitda margin expansion year future clearly look agency play short term hiccup air pocket ed say case structurally cut back cost get margin back need little bit unknown point long term would expect margin expand slightly base mix ashish sabadra okay helpful one final question gross late fee weigh low late fee weigh actually well help  well consumer environment think compression much visibility much confidence come second half go 2017 thank ed heffernan yes good visibility go second half large chunk probably half relate call consumer friendly program probably define basically mean look practice basically say continue premier provider marketplace customer friendly provider marketplace continue ramp bunch thing put place go back half last year example seem like lot move needle term someone get pay 15th month bill due 13th work well sometimes give everyone right move due date later month want seem like much actually affect late fee time also help opex see leverage much low talk time people call say need couple day people call use fee pay phone decide good practice take well take number thing system frankly cause grief add get lot back low opex term talk time everything else much happy client customer base think none dictate regulatory authority something proactively go think take hit see anniversary back half probably good thing hopefully pay dividend line ashish sabadra thank ed ed heffernan one okay operator david scharf jmp securities david scharf analyst jmp security good morning thank take question apologize advance ed repeat ask want clarification agency side give sense much business agency call project base versus guess work would deem annuity pretty reliable recur obviously base cmo budget vast majority business thing would deem quarter quarter project base necessarily great visibility ed heffernan definitely epsilon side case get one two year contract project project conversant side go volume drive basically  basically get lot unpredictability get agency long term contract flex base volume predict go quarter quarter basis difficult thing david david scharf got think cost structure obviously agency business always least amount operating leverage give people intensive talk disclosure agency roughly maybe one quarter epsilon segment traditional aspen business plus conversant standpoint percentage fix cost think ed heffernan would say premise right david high fix cost business people drive business variability pretty low part reason see ebitda quite bit quarter revenue agency flex much right exact percentage assume high fix cost business would within agency see structural issue market go address fix cost pretty quickly need david scharf okay think description lessening degree revenue decline q2 big number think 15 20 close 10 try get little bit context charles horn yes think position really say point go feel good go get well difficult comp q1 know go less q2 stage would difficult quantify q2 q3 q4 know david look guidance total single piece like first quarter performance area weakness would look year way difficult quantify quarter david david scharf got reference little bit loosening q2 maybe project base expect hope backlog start materialize come specifically large client may pull back unexpectedly new win new contract charles horn would say little bit new win come look focus course year think go see budget open little bit us year progress well ed say think little bit knee jerk reaction cmos q1 know tell head recession quite quickly us think many people listen rhetoric think project base discretionary base marketing think pull back little bit q1 david scharf got lastly card side sound like pretty guarded craft language regard two program renew fair say think two retailer partner perhaps willing commit much marketing push behind
